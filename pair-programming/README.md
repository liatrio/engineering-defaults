# **Pair Programming**

## Definition

Pair programming is an software development technique in which two engineers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two engineers switch roles frequently.

- Pair-programming provides extremely fast feedback on code and design in the moment reducing re-work and leading to more clean code and simplicity.  
- Teams that pair regularly exhibit better repeatability as we break down code ownership, have more consistency, and can deal better with team changes and absences.

## How to Pair Program?

- Each story/task is assigned to a pair of team members.​
- Infrastructure and operations work is also done in pairs (it is not special or different).​
- Each pair will use shared-screen pair programming as a daily practice, with the majority (>60%) of production code written in shared-screen (or driver-navigator) mode.  ​
- Code not written in shared-screen mode is reviewed in shared screen mode vs. async pull request methodologies​
- Any solo work is reviewed by a pair before being completed
- No team member consistently works solo. ​
- Pairs rotate regularly, no more than 2-3 days working together on a single story.​

## Measures for Pair Programming

The below metrics are lagging indicators for pair programming, pair programming is a behavior that a team should follow which helps them to accelerate in accomplishing delivery outcomes

- Development time: Code development time is faster
- Time to resolution: Time spent resolving bug/defects should be low
- Code quality: Code quality standards are always met
- People satisfaction: Improved work environment and culture

## Crawl - Walk - Run

| Phase | Activity| Measure|
| ------ | ------- | ----- |
| **Crawl** | Some work is done is pairs | % of stories that are being paired on |
| **Walk** |At least 50% of stories are done in pairs <br> Team decides on set of work to pair program | % of stories that are being paired on <br>  Establish baseline for the lagging metrics (above)  |
| **Run** |Any and all work done by the team is paired including operational tasks | Establish goals around lagging metrics and drive for improvement |
