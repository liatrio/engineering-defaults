# Engineering Defaults

Engineering Defaults outline the way product teams should operate under most circumstances. ​These practices outline the overall principles and ways of operating for the organization. ​Product Teams should continuously improve and focus to meet these goals. Engineering defaults are not binary - achieving engineering defaults is a journey.​ These principles are tightly intertwined and there is no correct order.​
