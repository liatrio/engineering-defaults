# **Smaller Stories**

## Definition

Small stories enable quicker deployments, frequent demos, and ultimately faster feedback. In addition, well-written smaller stories should allow any team member to pick up the work, enabling a more cross-functional and learning culture.

Write clear user stories with proper acceptance criteria, test scenarios, assumption clearly called out (As a `persona`, I want to `do something` so that I get `some value`)  

## How do I achieve Small Stories?

- Establish clear Definition of Ready / Definition of Done for the team
- Utilize a Three Amigos practice to breakdown Epics, Features, and Stories.
  - Include Product Owner, EBA, and rotating Engineers including QE. On occasion you may want to have the customer join in these conversations.
- **Breaking down Epics/Features:** Start by breaking down your Epics into manageable deliverable. Think of these segments as "Features".
  - Why is this "Feature" needed to meet the objective of the Epic?
  - What is the business value of this "Feature"? Is it necessary at this point in time?
  - How is the "Feature" going to improve the application? How does it impact the team? Is there enough skill set on the team to deliver?
- **Breaking down Stories**
    Now that you've broken down the Epics into more manageable segments (AKA "Features"), begin breaking down the feature into smaller deliverables, AKA Stories. Ensure that each story is clear with specific acceptance criteria and required information such as; Comps, Wires, and Architecture specifics. Any unnecessary information should be removed.
  - Why is this story necessary? Describe the value in the description of the story.
  - What is the purpose of this story? Be precise, if it has multiple purposes, break it out into multiple stories.
  - How is the story written? Does it have clear and intentional acceptance criteria? Does it have the necessary information that the engineers need? Be consistent with the approach, use a template, etc..

## How do I measure outcomes of Small Stories?

- Primary Measurement: **Cycle Time**
  - Calculation: measuring time in status for Jira stories, from _In-Progress_ to _Done_
- Alternate Measurements
  - **Story Points** : if pointing is used for planning and estimation, teams can look at the distribution of story points. Although pointing definitions would vary by team, smaller story points would result in smaller cycle time.

### Crawl - Walk - Run

| Phase | Activity| Measure|
| ------ | ------- | ----- |
| **Crawl** | Breakdown work into Epics/Stories that are well defined <br> Establish clear Definition of Ready / Definition of Done for the team | Cycle Time: 1 week|
| **Walk** | In addition to above, utilize a Three Amigos practice to breakdown Epics, Features, and Stories | Cycle Time: Between 1 day and 1 week  |
| **Run** | In addition to all of above, stories are small and vertically sliced to achieve business functionality | Cycle time :between hours and 1 day |
